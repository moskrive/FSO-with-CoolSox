# Cloud Microservices Demo Application

This project is based on the [original open-source microservices demo from Weaveworks](https://github.com/microservices-demo). Information about the application architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/blob/master/internal-docs/design.md).

Compared to the source has this repository been modified to work with auto-instrumentation from Appdynamics. In addition have the name of the demo company, etc. been changed.

This demo application is intended to run on a Kubernetes and can be deployed using helm.
